# Mastermind-Game
This is a web app recreation of the code-breaking game Mastermind.
This version substitutes numbers for colors. Read more about Mastermind here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))

# Technologies Used
• React <br/>
• Express <br/>
• Node <br/>
• PostreSQL/ElephantSQL <br/>
• Jest <br/>
• React Testing Library <br/>
• Supertest <br/>
• webpack <br/>
• SASS/SCSS <br/>
• JSDoc <br/>

# Setup
• Deployed via Netlify </br>
• To run locally, clone repo and navigate to the root directory and run the following commands in terminal </br>
`npm install` </br>
`npm run build` </br>
`npm run start` </br>

# Game Rules
• The objective of this game is to guess the secret number that is generated by the computer <br/> 
• At the start of the game the user will be prompted to select a difficulty level before starting <br/>
    - Easy: The secret number is 4 digits long. Each integer in the secret number will be from 0-4 inclusive. You will have 10 attempts <br/>
    - Medium: The secret number is 4 digits long. Each integer in the secret number will be from 0-5 inclusive. You will 9 attempts <br/>
    - Hard: The secret number is 5 digits long. Each integer in the secret number will be from 0-6 inclusive. You will 8 attempts <br/>
• At the end of each guess, the computer will provide one of the following response as feedback:<br/>
    - An X represents a number you guessed was correct but in the wrong location <br/>
    - An O represents a number you guessed was correct and in the right location <br/>
Note: The position of the X's and O's are not correlated to the position of the number in your guess or the secret number <br />

# Thought Process
My initial thought process was to first determine my tech stack and my MVP. I decided to with React for my frontend framework as well as 

An MVP feature I wanted to include was a leaderboard. I 

I followed a MVC pattern. However, during development I realized that this project will naturally be very frontend heavy. 


# Testing
This project uses Jest for TDD. run `npm run test` to view unit tests
